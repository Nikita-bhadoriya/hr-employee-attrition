Matplotlib & Seaborn
# Project Description
This project analyzes employee attrition in an organization using a real-world HR dataset. The aim is to discover the key factors leading to employee resignations and provide insights that help improve retention strategies.

# Key Objectives
Identify which employee factors contribute to attrition
Analyze trends across departments, job roles, and experience levels
Study the impact of age, income, and satisfaction on turnover
Build interactive dashboards for management insights
# Key Insights
High attrition observed among employees with low job satisfaction
Sales Executive and Research Scientist roles had higher attrition rates
Younger employees (25–35 years) are more likely to resign
Employees with fewer years at the company tend to leave more often
# Project Steps
Cleaned the dataset using Python (Pandas)
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib
Dropped unnecessary columns like EmployeeCount, Over18, StandardHours
Created an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize attrition trends
